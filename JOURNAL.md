## My Inspiration
For a year or so now, I've tried many digital systems (in Notion), but only a few worked. I would use it for a week max. and never visit the system again (It's just a me thing). That's why I decided I want to build a device that sits on your desk acting as your personal assistant. An all-in-one device; where you can track tasks, start focus sessions, and track habits, and ofc an alarm clock.

**TL;DR**: I WANT a custom built device, a minimalistic UI (to visualize, I'm aiming for a Apple Carplay look) that will help boost my productivity. Another way to think of it: A **featureful** alarm clock that does more than just time. P.S. I want touchscreen input
## Brainstorming
To know what parts/components I need, I first need to know the features for my device:

### MVP
#### Boot-to-Custom UI
- No linux desktop shown
- Boot straight into the UI
- Home screen with tappable apps
#### Touch Interface + View Navigation
- Carplay-style grid of icons
- Touch Response (tap → open app, swipe back, etc)
#### Alarm App
- User sets alarms from the UI
- System tracks time, rings sound, shows alarm screen
#### Habit Tracker App
- Daily habit list shown
- Tapping toggles complete/incomplete
- Auto-resets every day
#### Basic Focus Sessions
- Functional pomodoro timers, etc

### Post MVP (yes, I very much plan on improving DeskOS after highway)
#### AI
- Voice Assistant (so I can say "what are todays tasks" and get a quick summary)
- Analyze focus, habits, tasks trend
- And more...still coming up with post-mvp features
#### UI/UX Enhancements
- Smooth Animations
- Being able to add widgets to home screen
- Adding a custom splash screen and sound on boot
- Revamp themes/app icons, etc

> **Time Spent**: 4 Hours (Getting features down and researching)
